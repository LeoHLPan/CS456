\subsection{Transport Services and Protocols}

\begin{itemize}
\item They provide \emph{logical communication} between apps running on different hosts.
\item {\bf Transport protocols} run in end systems:
\begin{itemize}
\item The {\bf send side} breaks application messages into \emph{segments} and passes them to the network layer.
\item The {\bf receiver side} puts the segments back together into messages and passes the message to the app layer.
\end{itemize}
\item Multiple transport protocols are available to apps, including \emph{TCP and UDP} for transportation over the internet.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Transport vs. Network Layer}

\begin{itemize}
\item The {\bf network layer} is a logical communication between hosts.
\item The {\bf transport layer} is a logical communication between processes.
\end{itemize}
