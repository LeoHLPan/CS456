\subsection{Pure P2P Architecture}

\begin{itemize}
\item There is no always-on server.
\item End systems directly communicate with each other.
\item Peers are \emph{intermittently} connected and changes IP addresses often.
\item {\bf Examples}:
\begin{itemize}
\item File distribution (BitTorrent)
\item Streaming (KanKan)
\item VoIP (Skype)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{File Distribution Time}

\begin{itemize}
\item How does P2P compare with client-server in terms of file distribution of a size $F$ file from one server to $N$ peers:
\item Note that peer upload and download capacity is a \emph{limited resource}.
\item Note: $u_s = $ server upload capacity.
\item In the client-server architecture:
\begin{itemize}
\item Server transmission must sequentially send N file copies.
\item The time to send one copy is $F/u_s$, so the time to send $N$ copies is $NF/u_s$.
\item Client must download the file copies.
\item If $d_{min}$ is the minimum client download rate, then the minimum client download time is $F/d_{min}$.
\item Thus, the time to distribute file $F$ to $N$ clients using the {\bf client-server approach} is: $D_{c-s} \ge max\{NF/u_s,F/d_{min}\}$
\end{itemize}
\item In the P2P architecture:
\begin{itemize}
\item Server transmission must upload at least one copy, which has time $F/u_s$.
\item Clients must each download the file copy, which has min download time $F/d_{min}$.
\item Clients download a combined $NF$ bits, meaning the max upload rate... (?)
\end{itemize}
\item See example graph of client-server vs. P2P on slide 2-80.
\item {\bf TODO: Finish notes}
\end{itemize}
