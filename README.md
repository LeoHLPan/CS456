# CS456 - Computer Networks
### University of Waterloo
#### Spring 2018

<br />
Notes for CS456 from University of Waterloo. It follows material from the course slides and the textbook "James Kurose, Keith Ross - Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach (7th Edition)". Neither the course slides nor the textbook can be found here.

Note that although the section and subsections coverage match that which is used in the textbook and slides, the subsubsection coverage may differ. For example, although my section 1.2 covers the same content as the section 1.2 in the textbook, my section 1.2.1 may cover a different amount of material than the textbook's 1.2.1.

I did not have time to complete notes for chapter 3 before the midterm. The final is non-cumulative and only covers 3.5 onward, so sections 3.3 and 3.4 will be placed on low priority.

##### TODO (set on July 27, 2018):
- [ ] complete chapter 3
- [x] complete chapter 4
- [x] complete chapter 5
- [ ] complete chapter 6
