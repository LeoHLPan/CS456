# CS456 - Computer Networks
### University of Waterloo
#### Spring 2018

<br />
Notes for CS456 from University of Waterloo. The course slides will not be found here.

I did not have time to complete notes for chapter 3 before the midterm. The final is non-cumulative and only covers 3.5 onward, so sections 3.3 and 3.4 will be placed on low priority.

##### TODO (set on July 27, 2018):
- [ ] complete chapter 3
- [x] complete chapter 4
- [ ] complete chapter 5
- [ ] complete chapter 6
